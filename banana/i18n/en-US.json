  "why.title": "Why do Gemini images have watermark?",
  "why.body.1": "Gemini adds visible watermarks to AI-generated images to indicate their origin. This helps identify content created by AI models and prevents misuse or confusion with human-made images.",
  "why.body.2": "However, for many creators and designers, these watermarks can be distracting — especially when using Gemini images for presentations, mockups, or internal drafts.",
  "how.title": "How our Gemini watermark remover works",
  "how.body.1": "Our Gemini watermark remover is designed specifically for AI-generated images. Instead of applying generic blur or crop techniques, it analyzes the watermark pattern and removes it while preserving the original image details.",
  "how.body.2": "The entire process runs directly in your browser. Your image is never uploaded to a server, ensuring privacy and fast processing. In most cases, the watermark can be removed cleanly without noticeable quality loss.",
  "nano.title": "Does this work for Nano Banana watermark?",
  "nano.body.1": "Yes. This tool also supports newer Gemini image outputs, including Nano Banana watermark patterns.",
  "nano.body.2": "As Gemini models evolve, watermark styles may change. We continuously adapt the removal process to support the latest formats.",
